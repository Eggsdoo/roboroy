# Roboroy

Welcome to Roboroy! This application allows you to control a virtual robot on a 5x5 grid. Using intuitive controls, you can move the robot forward and rotate it to face any cardinal direction.

Inspired by the clean, modern aesthetics of Bellroy, this project features a user-friendly interface and functionality designed to showcase a simple yet interactive use of the React.js framework I am using.

Features
    Interactive Grid: A 5x5 grid where the robot moves.
    Robot Controls:
        Move Forward: Advances the robot one step in its current direction.
        Turn Left/Right: Rotates the robot to face a new direction (north, east, south, west).
    Real-Time Updates: Displays the robot's current position and facing direction.
    Responsive Design: Adapts gracefully to modern web browsers and devices.

Technologies Used
    React: For building the user interface.
    React Icons: For the visual representation of the robot.
    CSS Modules: For styling the grid and controls.
